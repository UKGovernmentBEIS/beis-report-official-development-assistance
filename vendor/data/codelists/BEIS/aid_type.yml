    name: Core contributions to multilateral institutions
    description:
      These funds are classified as multilateral ODA (all other categories
      fall under bilateral ODA). The recipient multilateral institution pools contributions
      so that they lose their identity and become an integral part of its financial
      assets. See Annex 2 of the DAC Directives for a comprehensive list of agencies
      core contributions to which may be reported under B02 (Section I. Multilateral
      institutions).

      Contributions to specific-purpose programmes and funds managed by international
      organisations (multilateral, INGO)
    description:
      In addition to their core-funded operations, international organisations
      set up and raise funds for specific programmes and funds with clearly identified
      sectoral, thematic or geographical focus. Donors’ bilateral contributions to such
      programmes and funds are recorded here, e.g. “UNICEF girls’ education”, “Education
      For All Fast Track Initiative”, various trust funds, including for reconstruction
      (e.g. Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund).

    name: Project-type interventions
    description:
      A project is a set of inputs, activities and outputs, agreed with the
      partner country*, to reach specific objectives/outcomes within a defined time
      frame, with a defined budget and a defined geographical area. Projects can vary
      significantly in terms of objectives, complexity, amounts involved and duration.
      There are smaller projects that might involve modest financial resources and last
      only a few months, whereas large projects might involve more significant amounts,
      entail successive phases and last for many years. A large project with a number
      of different components is sometimes referred to as a programme, but should nevertheless
      be recorded here. Feasibility studies, appraisals and evaluations are included
      (whether designed as part of projects/programmes or dedicated funding arrangements).
      Aid channelled through NGOs or multilaterals is also recorded here. This includes
      payments for NGOs and multilaterals to implement donors’ projects and programmes,
      and funding of specified NGOs projects. By contrast, core funding of NGOs and
      multilaterals as well as contributions to specific-purpose funds managed by international
      organisations are recorded under B. * In the cases of equity investments, humanitarian
      aid or aid channelled through NGOs, projects are recorded here even if there was
      no direct agreement between the donor and the partner country.
