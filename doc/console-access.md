# Console access

We need console access to bootstrap the service with users and organisations. We may need a way to access live environments for debugging or incident management purposes in future.

If we do need to open a rails console on production we should pair through the commands we execute to mitigate the risk of data loss.

## Prerequisites

You must have an account that has been invited to BEIS' AWS account, managed by BEIS/DSIT.

## Access

NOTE: This article is a stub.

Log in via AWS. Connect to an instance to gain access to the running containers.
