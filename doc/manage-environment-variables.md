# Manage environment variables

Environment variables are passed to live environments in two ways:

- through the task definitions in AWS
- through the AWS ParameterStore

## Adding a new environment variable

Adding a new environment variable is not something we can currently do ourselves, and requires asking the DSIT Digital team / Databarracks.

## Deploying changes to environment variables

To be confirmed:
- Can we change the value of env vars in ParameterStore?
- Does the app need to be redeployed in order for a change to env vars to take effect?
