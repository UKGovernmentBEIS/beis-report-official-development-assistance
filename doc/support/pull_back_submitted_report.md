# Pull back a submitted report

Sometimes a partner organisation realises that there is a mistake or omission in
a recently submitted (not approved) report. The fix is available to a DSIT user from with the RODA application:

- DSIT move report into "Review" state
- DSIT move report into "Request changes" state
- DSIT ask PO to make the desired changes and re-submit when ready
