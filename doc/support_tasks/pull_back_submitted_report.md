# Pull back a submitted report

Sometimes a delivery partner realises that there is a mistake or omission in 
a recently submitted (not approved) report. The fix is available to a BEIS user from with the RODA application: 

- BEIS move report into "Review" state
- BEIS move report into "Request changes" state
- BEIS ask DP to make the desired changes and re-submit when ready
