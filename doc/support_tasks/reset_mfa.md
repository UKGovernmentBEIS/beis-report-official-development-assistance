# Reset a user's multi-factor authentication

In the case where a user can't complete MFA because their phone number has
changed, support will need to manually reset the user's MFA settings via the
user edit page:

- log into RODA with an BEIS account
- locate the user via the 'Users' page, go to 'Edit'
- Select the "reset the user's mobile number checkbox" and save the user
- ask the user to log in again and to supply a valid mobile number when prompted

This will allow the user to continue using SMS-based two-factor authentication
for RODA.
