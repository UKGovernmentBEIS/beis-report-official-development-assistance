# IATI XML Validation

We aim for all XML outputs from this app to be valid against the [IATI Standard](https://iatistandard.org/en/).

If you have made any changes to the XML outputs, validate them against the [IATI XML validator](https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org) before committing.

Critical failures in the validation should be addressed in your PR; or if that's not possible then a ticket should be opened to address the issues in Trello.
