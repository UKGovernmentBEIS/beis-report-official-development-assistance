# Glossary of terms

## Activity

Generic term for any project undertaken by an organisation with BEIS money. Top level things such as funds (of which there are only two) are also activities in the code. See also fund, programme, project, third-party project. `Activity` in the code, with distinction by the `level` attribute.

## Actual spend
Also: actuals, transaction(s)

Money spent for an activity. `Transaction` in the code.

## Budget

Money allocated for an activity.

RODA currently recognises three types of budgets: direct, transferred, and external. Direct budgets are subtyped by the associated fund (GCRF or Newton).

## Codelists

Originally designating the specific codes (and their metadata) used by IATI. These are public, they have official versions, and must be used when preparing data to be reported to IATI. Stored in the `vendor` folder.

Extended to include BEIS-specific codes and metadata, also stored in the `vendor` folder. We prefer to record any such codes in a YAML file rather than in constants.

## DP
Delivery partner

An organisation that collaborates with BEIS to deliver aid to one or more countries or regions.

## Extending organisation

Terminology originating from IATI. According to IATI, this is "an organisation that manages the budget and direction of an activity on behalf of the funding organisation".

RODA uses this as a permission checker: users belonging to the `extending_organisation` have permission to create and modify projects (level C activities) that their organisation "extends"; permission to create child activities of programmes (level B activities) that their organisation extends.

## Financial quarter (and financial year)

A financial year 200n starts on 1 April 200n and ends on 31 March 200(n+1). It is divided in four quarters, numbered 1 to 4, each encompassing 3 calendar months.

E.g. the time period 1 Jan 2021 - 31 Mar 2021 is the 4th financial quarter of the financial year 2020.

In the app, we label them `FQ[1-4] 202n-202(n+1)`, e.g. `FQ4 2020-2021`. The financial year on its own is labelled `FY 202n`.

## Financials

A generic term for money associated with an activity: budgeted money, money that is forecast to be spent, and money that is actually spent.

NB: BEIS RODA is a reporting tool, not an accounting system. It is not responsible for error checking.

## Forecast spend
Also: planned disbursement, forecasts, forecasted spend

Money anticipated to be spent for an activity during a financial quarter.

## Fund
Also "level A"

One of two sources of financing for development assistance projects.

A fund is recorded as an activity entity, but there is also a `Fund` class that is not database-persisted.

## Implementing organisation

TBD

## Level

The only way of organising activities in a hierarchy that all the organisations seem to agree upon is to regard them as a four tier system, with the fund at the top as level A, and three "child" levels, B, C, and D.

## Programme
Also "level B"

An activity (a way of organising money, organisations, and people involved) recording how BEIS money is allocated and spent by a specific delivery partner organisation. BEIS is the organisation that manages programmes.

## Project
Also "level C"

An activity managed by a DP, recording how money is received and spent from BEIS on a specific activity (such an aid programme, a public health campaign etc). The DP is responsible for correctly reporting all the financial details, target areas, etc.

## Report

A record of the financials relating to an organisation's activities during a specific financial quarter. Forecasts are what the organisation thinks, at the time of reporting, that they will spend during each forecast financial quarter that is pertinent to that report.

Actuals are what money the organisation spent during the financial quarter relevant to the report.

##Â SID
Statistics on International Development

"This publication provides statistics about the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) the UK provided in [year], including UK ODA as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) (the ODA:GNI ratio) and various other breakdowns of ODA spend.""

## Third-party project
Also "level D"

An activity that is done on behalf of a DP by a third party, such as an university. It's the delivery partner that manages this activity and reports on the financials to BEIS, i.e. `third_party_project.extending_organisation = delivery_partner`

## Transfer

A way to record money that is being moved from one activity to another.
