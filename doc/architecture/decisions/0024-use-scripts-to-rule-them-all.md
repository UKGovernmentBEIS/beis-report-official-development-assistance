## Decision

We will follow the Scripts to Rule Them All pattern for common tasks in this project.

## Consequences

- it is easier to get the application running and perform common tasks without
  having a more in-depth knowledge of the code base
- the scripts act as documentation themselves. If developers use the scripts,
  then they only need to update them, without having to update documentation
  as well
