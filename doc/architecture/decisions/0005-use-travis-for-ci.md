# 5. use-travis-for-ci

Date: 2019-10-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Travis is actively used for many other projects within the BEIS GitHub account.

We know we will want to be using containers to run this application, so the tool we use must support Docker too. 

## Decision

Use Travis to build and test the application.

Use Travis to automatically deploy the applications to live.

## Consequences

Access and billing is controlled centrally through BEIS's GitHub account.
