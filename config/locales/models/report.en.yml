            This report is now activated and the delivery partner now has access to edit data, finalise and submit the report in RODA before the deadline.

            <p class="govuk-body">
            NOTE - the deadline is not enforced in RODA. If a report is not submitted within the timeframe it will need to be followed up outside of the service, i.e. by email
            </p>

            The Service Manager will send the delivery partner an email notifying them that RODA is now open and their reporting cycle has begun.  ODA PMO Finance Lead will send the commissioning email confirming the deadline and relevant service updates to DPs 2 weeks before the report submission deadline.
