// The styles for the dropdown arrow sets the z-index to -1 that seems to place
// it behind the autocomplete, this may be a bug, but this is a workaround for
// us, see: https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete/issues/351#issuecomment-582935867
.autocomplete__wrapper {
    z-index: 0;
}

// the autocomplete does not set a font, this only effects the autocomplete
// items, so we set it here
.autocomplete__hint,
.autocomplete__input,
.autocomplete__option {
  @include govuk-font($size: 19);
}
