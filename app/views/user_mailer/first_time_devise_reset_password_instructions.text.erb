Hi All,

As you will already know, BEIS is changing the way you authenticate to RODA. In order to do this you need to set your password now via the link below.

<%= edit_user_password_url(reset_password_token: @token) %>

You will be asked to enter your mobile number for two-factor authentication. You will continue to receive six-digit codes to this mobile number as before.

For reasons of security, we can't transfer your mobile number over automatically.

PLEASE NOTE - You can keep the password you currently use to log into RODA but this must meet these criteria:

<%= t("form.hint.user.new_password") %>

This link will expire in two weeks; after this, you can still reset your password at https://www.report-official-development-assistance.service.gov.uk/users/password/new

Please get in touch with BEIS via Zendesk if you need further support: support@beisodahelp.zendesk.com
